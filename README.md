# Handwritten_Digit_Classification

Problem Statement:
The task involves classifying handwritten digits into classes ranging from 0 to 9 using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to correctly classify a given digit image into its appropriate class.

Dataset:
The project uses the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 evaluation images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel square (784 pixels total), normalized and centered.

Methodology:

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier - Baseline Method:
K-NN finds the k nearest objects in the training set to the test object and assigns a label based on the predominance of a class in this neighborhood.
Pros include quick execution for small datasets, simplicity, and versatility. However, it's computationally expensive, memory-intensive, and slow in the prediction phase.
Multiclass Perceptron Classifier:
Constructed using multiple binary class classifiers trained with a one-vs-all strategy.
Each perceptron is trained separately, and the label with the highest confidence is assigned to the query instance.
Offers faster prediction times compared to K-NN due to precomputed weights.
SVM Classifier with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Features:
Extracts HOG features from digit images and trains an SVM classifier.
Comparison purposes only; not implemented in the project.
Analysis:

Accuracy: K-NN exhibits similar accuracy to Multiclass Perceptron and SVM.
Prediction Time (Efficiency): Multiclass Perceptron outperforms K-NN in prediction time efficiency due to precomputed weights and dot product computation.
Conclusion:
Multiclass Perceptron significantly improves prediction time efficiency compared to K-NN, mitigating its computational and memory limitations. It stands out as a more efficient and effective classifier for the task.
